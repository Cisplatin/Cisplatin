# Cisplatin

Cisplatin is my personal website, hosted on DigitalOcean. Eventually, the site will be hosted at http://www.cisplatin.xyz. The plan is to use this website to learn React.

The current vision is to have a beautifully interactive flow. The landing page will hopefully have some sort of interactive game, and the site itself will have many pages ranging from projects to my PGP key. The site should look good - that's among the main priorities.

## Running Cisplatin

Cisplatin can be run locally on 127.0.0.1:8000 with the following commands:

```Bash
git clone https://www.github.com/Xenonstory/Cisplatin
cd Cisplatin && sudo -H pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver 8000
```
