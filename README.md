# Cisplatin

Cisplatin is my personal website, hosted on DigitalOcean. Eventually, the site will be hosted at http://www.cisplatin.xyz. The plan is to use this website to learn React.

## Running Cisplatin

Cisplatin can be run locally on 127.0.0.1:8000 with the following commands:

```Bash
git clone https://www.github.com/Xenonstory/Cisplatin
cd Cisplatin && sudo -H pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver 8000
```
